Description: This package supports the investigation of biocViews 
	in relation to EDAM ontology.  We have measured semantic
	distance between biocViews terms and EDAM terms using
	text2term, a python system of Rafael Goncalves of
	Harvard Center for Computational Biomedicine.  Includes
        python code from Anh Nguyet Vu of Sage Bionetworks.
