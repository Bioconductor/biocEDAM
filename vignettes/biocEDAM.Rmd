# Introduction

The [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocViews) package
collects and organizes terms for tagging
resources in the Bioconductor ecosystem for
genomic data science.  As of November 2023 there
are 497 terms defining classes of resources in the
project.  Example terms are "Organism", "BiologicalQuestion",
"Sequencing", "MicroarrayData".  Contributors and core
members assign tags from this vocabulary to software
packages, data resources, and workflows that are managed
and distributed by the project.
