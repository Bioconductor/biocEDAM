# biocEDAM
preliminary investigation of biocViews in relation to EDAM ontology

## Purpose

[biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocViews) is an ad hoc vocabulary in
the form of a graphNEL instance with over 400 terms.  [EDAM](https://edamontology.org)
is an OWL model of a vocabulary devoted to concepts of data analysis and data management
in the biosciences.  This package unites these two resources with the objective of
permitting exploration that will lead to formal ontological tagging of all Bioconductor
software and data packages and workflows.
