<p>Inspired by Herve Menager’s <a href="https://github.com/vjcitn/biocEDAM/issues/1">issue</a>, I examined the <a href="https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/" class="external-link">ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem</a> source repo for <a href="https://github.com/research-software-ecosystem/content/tree/master/data" class="external-link">metadata on biotools components</a>. Information here was filtered using code in the inst/scrapes folder of the biocEDAM package. This information and the <code>biotools_bioc</code> data.frame in this package should be updated regularly.</p>
